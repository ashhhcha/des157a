    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I will update the Every Picture project's visual design and UX/UI.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The Every Picture project features a gallery of photos taken from aquariums. Each image has a short description of the particular animal, discussing their geographic location, dimensions, and distinct physical characteristics.</p>
        <p>Regarding the project's visual design, I will fix the transition between the first to second pages. It is currently an instantaneous change, and I want to add a zoom transition for the first page that will transition into the next. I will also revise the spacing issues with the images, specifically at the end. The last photo's margin does not appear, and provides no spacing between the edge of the page with the photo.</p>
        <div>
            <img src="images/nospace.jpg" alt="no space example">
        </div>  
        <p>As for the UX/UI aspect, an arrow on the front of the second page will be added to help indicate to the user that you can scroll horizontally to view the photos, as a horizontal scroll is not intuitive for the user. Text will appear after the scroll to show you can click on the photo to learn more. At the right end of the page, I will include a button that lets the user scroll and jump back to the front beginning of the page. This prevents them from scrolling excessively to go to the beginning.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <p>To improve the visual design, I will consult the DES 157B Teaching Assistants, who both have experience with visual design. I will also be consulting Maggie's friend who graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a degree in computer science who can discuss and help elements to implement with UX/UI design. I will also connect with Professor Wheeler to see how I can improve my UX/UI design.</p>
