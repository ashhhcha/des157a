    <h2>Critique from Teaching Assistants</h2>
    <p>Nikita and Sky had taken a look at my Every Picture project for the final. They are both teaching assistants for the Interactive Media II course, and have experience with visual and UX/UI design. The strong points noted were good visuals of the information overlays after the user clicks on the images, and the structure of information. Nikita suggested adding more space at the right edge so the photo is not against the screen, and also noted perhaps adding animation on the second page since it seems too static currently. Sky also added that the first page should have an animation that transitions into the second page.</p>
