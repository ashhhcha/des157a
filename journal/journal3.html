        <p>The article, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a>, encourages the reader to stop and take a more careful look at photos. The website <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/the-unconventional-gallery-interactive-and-immersive-webgl-gallery-exhibition">The Unconventional Gallery</a>, by makemepulse, has a similar effect. It caught my eye because the interactive website allows you to scroll through the gallery of projects and works, as if you were browsing through one. I thought the scrolling connected with the walking was a unique element because it creates a unique environment and theme for the website. Most often, individuals display their works with a vertical scroll. However, the background taking place in a gallery makes the viewer slow down and want to engage with the content presented.
