        <p>Amir Dori discusses in the article "Game Design UX Best Practices" about specific aspects of the game that influence user experience. While I knew about the different reach positions on devices, I never thought about the "x" button and the placement of it. I thought it was interesting that a small change can have a difference in influencing user behavior and spending more time in the app.</p>
        <p>One thing I noted that I have a slight disagreement with is the anchor points on draggable options. While I understand that the anchor points are set where the hand will not obstruct the view of the object, it does not always align with their point that the point should be where the user would actually hold the item as in the real world. Because everyone has various preferences, how one holds an object in real life differs. The intuitive dragging point may be a different spot from one person to another.</p>
