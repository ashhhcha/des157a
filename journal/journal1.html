        <h2>Journal 1</h2>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design"</a>, written by Salim Ansari, suggests various methods to increase the usability of a design. Small choices can make an impactful difference. Some practices focused on not overwhelming the viewer, such as making the form shorter or grouping forms into stages if the form cannot be shortened. These simplify the form and create a more narrow focus on fields to prevent.</p>
        
        <p>The article also suggests multiple methods to present information instead of having the user work for it. This is seen in the use of checkboxes instead of a dropdown menu, and an explanation of the reason to collect sensitive information below the field box.</p>
        
        <p>I believe the points the author made were helpful. All practices can help streamline the user's interaction with the design.</p>

        <p>A website that displays great practice is the <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/get-started/payment?campaignId=6W9YY&o=ae666bd5-aa06-11ec-84c9-227543ace765">New York Times Subscription</a> form. It divides the form into three sections (account, payment, review), lists of payment options that expand for the user to fill out the information after selecting an option, and maintains mostly single columns, with field sizes adjusted according to the information it needs. </p>
