        <p>Written by the Nielsen Norman Group, the article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays</a> discusses the various aspects of overlays and the proper method of using them. An overlay is a small box that pops up and appears on the webpage, and can be used for different reasons. It reviews and asks you to consider who you are designing for, goal, purpose, timing, and placement when creating an overlay.</p>

        <p>The best overlays take into account a few questions. Considering the view of the overlay ensures users on any device can clearly see it appearing transformed or distorted. Also, you need to consider the action you want the user to complete, ensure the time the overlay appears does not interrupt what they are doing needs to be thought about, and that the placement is within the user's primary sight. Considering if you need an overlay, or if the information can be displayed on the page instead can help shape the user's experience. </p>
